## Integration Instructions

### 1. Adding the Games to Your Website
1. Upload the `/games/` directory to your web server.
2. Ensure the file structure is maintained as described above.

### 2. Linking the Games
Add links to the games from your main `index.html` page. Example:

```html
<h2>Play Our Games:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="games/tic-tac-toe.html">Tic-Tac-Toe</a></li>
  <li><a href="games/rock-paper-scissors.html">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a></li>
  <li><a href="games/ping-pong.html">Ping Pong (2P)</a></li>
  <li><a href="games/snake.html">Snake</a></li>
  <li><a href="games/aim-trainer.html">Aim Trainer</a></li>
  <li><a href="games/jumping-ball.html">Jumping Ball</a></li>
  <li><a href="games/ping-pong-single.html">Ping Pong (1P)</a></li>
</ul>
```

### 3. Customizing the Appearance
To ensure visual consistency, you can customize the CSS of each game by modifying their internal `<style>` tags or linking an external stylesheet.

For example, to apply a common style, add the following to your `style.css`:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    background: #1e1e2f;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
}

h2 {
    color: #4caf50;
}
```

### 4. Improving Navigation
You may want to add a "Back to Home" button on each game page for easy navigation. Add the following HTML snippet to each game file:

```html
<button onclick="window.location.href='/index.html'">Back to Home</button>
```

## Deployment
Ensure your hosting provider supports static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Popular options include:

- **GitHub Pages**: Free and easy for static sites.
- **Netlify**: Supports static hosting with automatic deployment from Git.
- **Vercel**: Fast and reliable for frontend projects.
